🌍 World Layoffs EDA (SQL)
📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a global layoffs dataset using SQL. The primary objective is to clean, process, and analyze layoffs data to extract meaningful business insights, identify trends, and summarize the patterns across companies, industries, countries, and funding stages.



📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about global company layoffs including:

🏢 company: Name of the company

📍 location: Office location

🏭 industry: Industry sector

👥 total_laid_off: Number of employees laid off

📈 percentage_laid_off: Percentage of workforce affected

📅 date: Layoff date

💰 stage: Funding stage of the company

🌎 country: Country of the company

💵 funds_raised_millions: Total funds raised in millions




🧹 Data Cleaning

The EDA project includes:

❌ Removing duplicates – Ensuring each record is unique.

✨ Standardizing data – Trimming spaces, fixing inconsistent industry and country names.

🟢 Handling NULL or blank values – Filling missing data or removing irrelevant records.

🛠️ Fixing data types – Converting dates, numbers, and percentages to proper SQL types.




📈 Analysis Performed

🏢 Company-level analysis – Total layoffs, average percentage laid off, and ranking companies by layoffs.

🏭 Industry-level analysis – Identifying industries with the highest layoffs.

🌎 Country-level analysis – Summarizing layoffs by country.

📅 Time-based trends – Monthly layoffs, rolling totals, and yearly layoffs to detect patterns over time.

🏆 Top companies per year – Ranking top 5 companies with highest layoffs for each year.




💻 SQL Techniques Used

SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY for aggregation and sorting.

Window functions: ROW_NUMBER(), SUM() OVER(), DENSE_RANK() for rankings and cumulative totals.

WITH clause (CTEs) for intermediate results.

UPDATE and ALTER TABLE for data cleaning.

String functions: TRIM(), SUBSTRING(), STR_TO_DATE() for standardizing text and dates.




🔍 Insights

Identified companies with maximum layoffs and percentage affected.

Observed trends of layoffs over months and years.

Determined industries and countries most impacted by layoffs.

Highlighted top companies per year based on layoffs.




🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to gain actionable insights from raw layoff data using SQL, practice data cleaning and aggregation techniques, and demonstrate the ability to conduct exploratory analysis on real-world datasets.
